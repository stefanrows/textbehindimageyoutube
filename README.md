Then follow the same steps as above, but replace `npm` with `pnpm`:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## üéØ How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Launch the Application
After running `npm run dev` (or `pnpm run dev`), you'll see something like:
```
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/`

### Step 2: Upload Your Image
1. Click on the "Upload Image" section
2. Click "Choose file" and select your image (JPG, PNG, or GIF)
3. Your image will appear on the canvas
4. **Automatic Background Removal**: The app will automatically start removing the background from your image
   - You'll see a processing indicator while the AI works
   - This usually takes a few seconds depending on image complexity
   - Once complete, you'll see a preview showing:
     - **Original Image**: Used as the background layer
     - **Subject**: Your subject with transparent background (top layer)

### Step 3: Add Your Text
1. In the "Text Settings" section, enter your desired text
2. Customize your text:
   - **Font**: Choose from 9 available fonts
   - **Size**: Adjust with the slider (20-100px)
   - **Color**: Click the color picker to choose text color
   - **Outline**: Set outline color and width for better visibility
   - **Opacity**: Make text semi-transparent if needed
   - **Position**: Use X/Y controls or "Click to Place" mode

3. Click "Add Text Behind Subject" (if background was removed) or "Add Text to Canvas"

**‚ú® Smart Text Positioning**: When adding text behind a subject, the app automatically:
- Analyzes the subject's position and size
- Places text in the optimal location to avoid overlap
- Shows a golden glow effect for 3 seconds to make the text visible
- Automatically selects the text so you can see its position
- Displays helpful notifications with positioning tips

### Step 4: Fine-tune Your Design
- **Drag Elements**: Click and drag text or images to reposition them
- **Layer Management**: Use the Layers panel to:
  - Select different elements
  - Reorder layers with up/down arrows
  - Delete unwanted elements
- **Undo/Redo**: Use Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y or the undo/redo buttons

### Step 5: Export Your Thumbnail
1. In the "Export & Actions" section:
   - Choose your format (PNG recommended for thumbnails)
   - Adjust quality if needed (100% recommended)
2. Click "Export YouTube Thumbnail (1280√ó720)" for YouTube-optimized thumbnails
3. Or click "Export Full Canvas" to export the entire workspace
4. Your file will be automatically downloaded

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Application won't start:**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
- Check if port 5173 is available (close other development servers)

**Background removal not working:**
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection (background removal happens automatically after upload)
- Try with a different image (clear subjects with good contrast work best)
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF
- **Note**: Background removal starts automatically after image upload - no manual action needed

**Text not appearing:**
- Make sure text content is not empty
- Check if text color matches background (try white text with black outline)
- Verify text opacity is above 0%
- **New**: Look for the golden glow effect when text is first added - this indicates text is present but may be behind the subject
- **New**: Check if text is auto-selected (you'll see selection handles around it)
- **New**: Use the Layers panel to select and locate text objects

**Export not working:**
- Make sure you have uploaded an image first
- Check if your browser allows downloads from this site
- Try a different export format

**Performance issues:**
- Use smaller images (under 5MB recommended)
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Try refreshing the page and starting over

### Browser Compatibility:
- **Recommended**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Minimum**: Any browser with ES6 support and HTML5 canvas
- **Note**: Internet Explorer is not supported

### File Size Recommendations:
- **Images**: Under 5MB for best performance
- **Dimensions**: Any size (automatically scaled to fit canvas)
- **Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF supported for upload
